# Website-University_Project
### Welcome to the GitHub repository for my school project on improving our university's website!

The goal of this project is to make the university website more user-friendly and visually appealing for all users, including current students, faculty, staff, and prospective students. Our team will be working on a variety of tasks to accomplish this goal . 

## Project Overview

### To achieve our goal, we will be working on the following tasks:

+ Conducting user research to understand the needs and preferences of our website visitors.
+ Redesigning the website's layout and navigation to make it more intuitive and easy to use.
+ Creating new graphics and visual elements to enhance the website's visual appeal.
+ Optimizing the website's performance and loading speed.
+ Adding new features and functionalities to improve the user experience.

We will be using GitHub to track our progress and collaborate with team members. Git will be used to manage versions of our code, and we will use GitHub issues to assign and track tasks. We will also use GitHub Pages to host a live demo of our updated website.
